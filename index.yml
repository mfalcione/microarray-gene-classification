title: Gene Selection and Classification of Microarray Data using Various Machine Learning Techniques
author: Arun Balaji, Matthew Falcione
abstract: In bioinformatics studies, the selection of relevant genes for
sample classification is a common task. The goal of this project is to
compare the accuracy of re-sults obtained via various machine learning
methods such as random forest, XGBoost, neural network, line-ar discriminant
analysis, k nearest neighbor, logistic re-gression, and support vector
machine to those de-scribed in the reference paper [1]. The dataset used
10 cancer datasets obtained from various sources, span-ning thousands
of genes and hundreds of patients. For classification, the models were
run on each subset of attributes chosen by the feature selection models
as well as the raw data for each dataset. The preprocessed data is stored
locally to skip redundancies and for speed of analysis. Tree-based and
Logistic Regression recur-sive feature elimination methods performed best
with percent errors of 17.514% +/- 12.51% and 15.623% +/- 15.517%,
respectively. Feature selection perfor-mance increases across all datasets
for SVM ranged from 0% to 28.6% with an average of 8.47% +/- 8.73%, and
performance increases across all datasets for KNN ranged from 0% to 14.3%
with an average of 6.88% +/- 5.82%. The teamâ€™s models were able to produce
better performance than those from the origi-nal paper for each dataset.
The experiments also show that feature selection with SVM and KNN models
produced a lower error rate than when they were run with the raw features.
Logistic regression outperformed all other methods on average, but the
random forest model performed best most consistently.
